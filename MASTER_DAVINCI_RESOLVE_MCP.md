## Known Limitations

This section documents known limitations of the DaVinci Resolve API that affect the MCP functions:

1. **Project Settings Limitations**: Most project settings cannot be modified through the API. See `docs/project_settings_limitations.md` for details.
2. **Timeline Marker Limitations**: The API for timeline markers appears to be inconsistent or incomplete.
3. **Playback Control Timing**: Some playback control operations may have timing issues or inconsistent behavior.
4. **Version-Specific Issues**: Some functions may behave differently across DaVinci Resolve versions.

## Testing and Verification Methodology

This section outlines how features are tested and verified:

1. **Unit Testing**: Individual functions are tested in isolation with appropriate input parameters
2. **Integration Testing**: Functions are tested together to ensure they work as expected in combination
3. **Edge Case Testing**: Functions are tested with unusual or extreme input values
4. **Version Testing**: Functions are tested across multiple DaVinci Resolve versions when possible
5. **Error Handling Testing**: Functions are tested with invalid inputs to ensure proper error handling
