# DaVinci MCP Professional v2.1.0
A modern, professional implementation of a Model Context Protocol server for DaVinci Resolve integration.

## What Makes This Professional
This is a complete architectural rewrite and cleanup of existing DaVinci Resolve MCP implementations:

- **Clean Architecture**: Proper separation of concerns between MCP protocol and DaVinci Resolve API
- **Modern Python**: Uses current best practices with type hints, async/await, and comprehensive error handling
- **Simplified Setup**: Single command installation with automatic dependency management
- **Windows Compatible**: Proper encoding handling and console output for Windows environments
- **Standardized Dependencies**: Uses `uv` for fast, reliable dependency management
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Built-in test suite to verify functionality
- **Production Ready**: Clean codebase suitable for professional environments

## Architecture Highlights
This implementation emphasizes:

- **Reliability**: Comprehensive error handling and graceful failure modes
- **Maintainability**: Clean separation of concerns and modular design
- **Performance**: Efficient async/await patterns and minimal overhead
- **Compatibility**: Cross-platform support with Windows-specific optimizations
- **Professional Standards**: Proper logging, testing, and documentation
